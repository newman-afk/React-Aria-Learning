# Why React Aria?

ðŸ‘‰ [Official Documentation][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference Why React Aria?]

I'm not sure. Unstyled Components are good for design or development, and I guess the reason I choice React Aria just because it did very well than a lot of others.

Unstyled Components had only one job, accessiblity, any mistake is unacceptable
